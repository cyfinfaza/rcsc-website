<h2>About</h2>
<p>
	For those unfamiliar with the term, a hackathon is a collaborative coding event where beginners
	and professionals alike can employ new technologies to create a final product to pitch in front of
	judges.
</p>
<p>
	Ridgehacks is a <strong>free</strong> 12 hour hackathon running from 8AM to 8PM with judging from industry,
	professional, and academic leaders lasting until 10PM.
</p>
<p>
	We will provide breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks throughout the day along with generous prizes
	and swag so stay tuned for more updates!
